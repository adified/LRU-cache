# LRU-cache

Least Recently Used (LRU) is a cache replacement algorithm that replaces cache when the space is full. It allows us to access the values faster by removing the least recently used values. LRU cache is a standard question most of the time, it is usually asked directly but sometimes can be asked with some variation.
